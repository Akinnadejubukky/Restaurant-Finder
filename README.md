# Restaurant-Finder
A restaurant finder app built with embedded javascript and express/node.js
A user can signup or login to check up different restaurants near them.
If a user like a particular restaurant, they can add to their wishlist, and also remove from wishlist if they want to.
I want to use google places API to add restaurants from different locations but i'm having issue with it.
This app is still `In Progress`, there are many features that still needs to be added to it.
